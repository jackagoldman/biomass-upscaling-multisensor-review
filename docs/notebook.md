# Literature review and metanalysis

## 1.1 Initial Research Question: What methodologies have been used to scale aboveground biomass (AGB) estimates from airborne LiDAR  to satellite-based observations in boreal and coniferous forests, and how do these approaches compare in terms of accuracy and scalability?

**PECO/PICO framework**
P (Population)
 * Boreal and temperate coniferous forests.


E (Exposure / Intervention)
 * Use of airborne or UAV LiDAR for estimating forest structural attributes (e.g., aboveground biomass, tree height, volume).


C (Comparator)
 * Scaling or upscaling these estimates to satellite-based observations (optical, SAR).


O (Outcome)
 * Predictive performance metrics such as accuracy (R²), error (RMSE, MAE), and methodological effectiveness for biomass estimation.
